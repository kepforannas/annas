## A Few Tips for Using Buttons
- to display the "Button List" view
```javascript
let buttons = new Buttons();
buttons.setBody("ngapain bg?");
buttons.addSelection("List Menu");
buttons.makeSections("#! - Show All Menu List!!", "");
buttons.makeRow(
    "#! - Show All Menu",
    "display all menu in the bot !!!",
    "you can see all the features in this bot",
    `${prefix}menuall`
);
await buttons.run(m.chat, client, m);
```
- to display the "Button Copy" view
```javascript
let buttons = new Buttons();   
buttons.setBody("ngapain bg?");
buttons.addCopy("Copy", `puqi`);
await buttons.run(m.chat, client, m);
```
## To change/modify the bot's display section, you can go to:
```javascript
("./start/lib/buttondoc.js")
```
